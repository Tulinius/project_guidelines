# Research Plan
_Weeks 1-2_

The next key step in conducting scientific research is to make a research plan. This will summarise the motivation for your project, its aim(s), the methods you intend to use in your experiments, and the expected outcomes of the project. A well-written research plan can make it much more straightforward to conduct experiments and write them up.

I would suggest trying to summarise the following on a single side of A4:
- **The clinical background to the project**: 1- 2 sentences
- **The problem being tackled**: 1- 2 sentences
- **Current approaches to tackling this problem**: 1- 2 sentences
- **The aim(s) of this project**: 1- 2 sentences, indicating how your project will help tackle the problem. You could have an overall aim, and then a few (perhaps 3) objectives, where each objective refers to a research question which you intend to answer.
- **The methods to be used in this project:** 4-5 sentences providing key details of the methods you intend to use, such as the dataset and a brief overview of the analyses you will conduct. You may find it helpful to split the methods into parts (_e.g._ one part per research question).
- **The expected outcomes**: 1- 2 sentences on how this project will help tackle the problem.

The research plan does not need to be detailed - for instance, you probably won't know at this stage how many participants are in the dataset, or which statistical tests you might perform. Rather, it should provide a high-level summary of the project.
