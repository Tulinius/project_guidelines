# Literature Review
_Weeks 1-2_

A literature review is a key step in performing valuable scientific research. It allows you to: 
1. Understand the problem being tackled
2. Appreciate current approaches to tackle the problem
3. Identify potential areas for further research to move the field forward

Your literature review will provide a basis with which to define the aim(s) of your project, and potentially provide insight into how you could design your experiments to address these aims (perhaps building on the methodology used in previous studies). Therefore, it is important to get started on a literature review early in the project.

Ideally, a literature review should critically appraise the literature, rather than simply stating what has been said in the literature. Usually, a review of between 1,000 and 3,000 words is appropriate. You may wish to add to your literature review during the project if you find additional relevant publications.

I would suggest the following steps to create a literature review:

**Explore your project:** Discuss the project with me, and have a quick look into key topics underpinning the project, in order to understand it more fully. Explore our current understanding of the three items listed above: (i) the problem being tackled; (ii) current approaches to tackle the problem; and (iii) potential areas for further research.

**Search for relevant publications:** Use [search engines](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/info/tools/search_engines.html) to identify key publications relating to the project, bearing in mind the three items above. You will probably find too many publications to read in a year, let alone a 6-week project, so be selective. Often a review article can help to understand the broader context in which the literature sits - feel free to ask me if I would recommend any particular review articles.

**Extract information from the publications:** Having identified key publications, read them and make notes on any relevant points in the publications. Relevant points could include: (i) the clinical significance of the problem being tackled; (ii) the aims and findings of previous research in the field; (iii) the methodology used in previous studies; and (iv) suggested directions for future research (which could either be stated explicitly, or which you may identify by recognising gaps in the research conducted).

**Sort the information:** Categorise and sort the information into themes - ideally you should expect to write one paragraph on each theme. Remove any information which you think isn't too relevant.

**Structure your writing:** You are now in a position to structure your literature review. I would suggest an Introduction and a Conclusion, and between these, a paragraph on each theme. The paragraphs on each theme could follow this format:
- **Point:** A single sentence summarising the point you will make (_e.g._ Most of the literature on screening for atrial fibrillation has used 12-lead ECG recordings.)
- **Quotations:** Several sentences in which you refer to the evidence supporting this point - perhaps one or two sentences per publication (_e.g._ Doliwa _et al._ assessed the performance of a single-lead ECG device against reference diagnoses from 12-lead recordings [[ref](https://doi.org/10.1080/14017430802593435)].).
- **Comment:** A single-sentence providing your (critical) view on the significance of this point. (_e.g._ 12-lead ECGs are often viewed as a gold standard reference against which to compare single-lead ECGs, as demonstrated by the inclusion of such studies in [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg35/resources/leadi-ecg-devices-for-detecting-symptomatic-atrial-fibrillation-using-single-time-point-testing-in-primary-care-pdf-1053752401861) relating to Lead-I ECG devices.)

**Write your review:** Perhaps start by writing the paragraph on each theme, and then write the Introduction and Conclusion last.

**Provide references:** Use a reference manager to provide inline citations, and a list of references (feel free to ask me for recommendations).

**Proof-read your review:** Ideally, don't look at the review for a couple of days after writing the first draft, and then re-read it to identify any areas for improvement.
