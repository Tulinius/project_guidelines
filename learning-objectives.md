# Learning objectives
_Week 1_

It is good to firstly think about what you would like to learn from the project. You may find it helpful to list some learning objectives, which could include:
- Being able to explain the clinical background to the problem
- Gaining experience across each of the different stages of a research project
- Developing particular research skills (_e.g._ writing a literature review, using statistical analysis techniques, writing code)
- Preparing an abstract suitable for conference submission
- Understanding good practice for clinical research (such as by undertaking a [Good Clinical Practice](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/health-and-care-professionals/learning-and-support/good-clinical-practice.htm) course)

We will discuss your hopes for the project during the first week. This process will help me tailor the project towards your personal learning objectives.
