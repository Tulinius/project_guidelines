## Recognising contributors

Contributors to the Book who have GitHub accounts can be recognised using the 'All Contributors' app (see details [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)).

## Creating the book

The book was created as follows (largely following the instructions provided [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/your-first-book.html)):
```{dropdown} **Steps to create the book:** 
1. Install Jupyter book via conda-forge (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html))
2. Create a template book (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/create.html))
3. Modify the template to include content from Peter Charlton's original project guidelines (available [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/info/tools/project_guidelines.html)).
4. Build the book (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/build.html)).
5. Publish the book online (storing the source files in a GitHub repository, and publishing the book using GitHub pages, as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/publish.html)).
