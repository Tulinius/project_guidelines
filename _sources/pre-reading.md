# Pre-reading

_Pre-project_

You may want to start work on the project early, in which case I would recommend reading some key articles in the field. These could be on topics such as:
- The clinical background to the project.
- Current approaches being used to tackle the problem.
- Previous research conducted by our group which relates to the project.

I will be happy to recommend some suitable articles.
