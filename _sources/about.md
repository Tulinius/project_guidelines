About this Book
=======================

## Authors

This initial draft was written by [Peter H. Charlton](https://peterhcharlton.github.io).

It is hoped that it can become a collaborative project involving additional contributors.

## Creating the book

1. Install Jupyter book via conda-forge (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html))
2. Create a template book (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/create.html))
3. Modify the template to include content from Peter Charlton's original project guidelines (available [here](https://peterhcharlton.github.io/info/tools/project_guidelines.html)).
4. Build the book (as detailed [here](https://jupyterbook.org/start/build.html)).
