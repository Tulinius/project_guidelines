# Project Planning

_Pre-project_

A project requires some advanced planning to make it a success. Key elements include:

**Identifying a research question:** This should ideally be of interest to both the student and supervisor. It should also provide a helpful line of investigation: helping the student to gain experience and skills, and helping the supervisor with their wider research.

**Ensuring everything is ready for the project:** It is important to ensure that everything is in place for the project. Consider: ethical approvals, data availability, additional collaborators.
