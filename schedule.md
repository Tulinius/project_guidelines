Schedule
=======================

This page provides example schedules for projects. They are intended to be used as a guide, and some flexibility will be required.

## 6-week research project

The following schedule is designed to allow students to gain experience at each stage of a research project, develop new skills, and make valuable contributions to our ongoing research studies:

| Week | Tasks |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pre-project | [Project planning](../project-planning) <br> [Pre-reading](../pre-reading) |
| 1 | [Learning objectives](../learning-objectives) <br> [Literature review](../literature-review) <br> [Research Plan](../research-plan) <br> [Data Access](../data-access) |
| 2 | [Literature review](../literature-review) <br> [Research Plan](../research-plan) <br> [Data Access](../data-access) |
| 3 | [Experiments](../experiments) <br> [Project Report](../project-report) |
| 4 | [Experiments](../experiments) <br> [Project Report](../project-report) |
| 5 | [Experiments](../experiments) <br> [Project Report](../project-report) |
| 6 | [Project Report](../project-report) <br> [Project Presentation](../project-presentation) <br> [Abstract](../abstract) |
| Post-project | [Conference Submission](../conference-submission) <br> [Journal Publication](../journal-publication) |

In my experience, this is a challenging but rewarding schedule for a 6 week project.
